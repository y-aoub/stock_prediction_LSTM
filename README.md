# LSTM Method for Stock Price Forecasting

## Overview

Trying to predict how the securities exchange will work is one of the most difficult tasks. There are so many variables involved with the expectation – physical elements versus psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour, and so on.

All of these factors combine to make share costs unpredictable and difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.
Is it possible to use AI to our advantage in this space? AI approaches will potentially reveal examples and insights we hadn’t seen before, and these can be used to make unerringly exact expectations, using features like the most recent declarations of an organization, their quarterly income figures, and so on.

We will work with published information regarding a freely recorded organization’s stock costs in this report.
We’ll use a combination of AI calculations to forecast a company’s future stock price with LSTM.

The code is made up of 6 parts:

- **Loading the Data.**
- **Train and Test Split.**
- **Data Preprocessing.**
- **LSTM.**
- **Prediction.**

## Results

Various parameters of the LSTM model can be tweaked, such as the number of LSTM layers, the dropout value, and the number of epochs. Are the LSTM projections, however, precise enough to predict whether the stock price will rise or fall? Without a doubt.

Stock prices are influenced by company news as well as other factors such as demonetization or company mergers and demergers. In addition, many intangible variables are difficult to predict in advance.
