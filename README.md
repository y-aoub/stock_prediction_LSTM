# LSTM Method for Stock Price Forecasting

## Introduction

Trying to predict how the securities exchange will work is one of the most difficult tasks. There are so many variables involved with the expectation – physical elements versus psychological factors, rational and irrational behaviour, and so on.

All of these factors combine to make share costs unpredictable and difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.
Is it possible to use AI to our advantage in this space?AI approaches will potentially reveal examples and insights we hadn’t seen before, and these can be used to make unerringly exact expectations, using features like the most recent declarations of an organization, their quarterly income figures, and so on.

We will work with published information regarding a freely recorded organization’s stock costs in this report.
We’ll use a combination of AI calculations to forecast this company’s future stock price with LSTM.
